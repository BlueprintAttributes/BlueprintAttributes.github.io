The Attribute Set Blueprint Base class is able to handle those Min/Max column values, and execute a built-in clamping behavior.\nwith Gameplay Clamped Attribute Data properties - A customizable clamping using a special Gameplay Clamped Attribute Data property (a child of FGameplayAttributeData) with float or Attribute-based clamping.\nManual Clamping - You'd implement the clamping behavior yourself, with your own rules with the BP exposed method / events of Attribute Sets (PreAttributeChange(), PreAttributeBaseChange() or PostGameplayEffectExecute())\nUGBAAttributeSetBlueprintBase::PostGameplayEffectExecute() is the method responsible of clamping, and the order for those is the following:\nManual Clamping (if done in PostGameplayEffectExecute BP Event)\nClamping via Clamped Properties (if the Attribute is implemented as a FGBAGameplayClampedAttributeData).\nClamping via DataTables Min and Max value columns (if the Set was initialized with a DataTable, and if MinValue < MaxValue).\nTest Setup To better illustrate the clamping behavior in-game, we'll use Gameplay Effects with Infinite duration to setup a regen and degen mechanic for the Health Attribute.\nYou could also use Gameplay Abilities activated on Input, to apply an Instant Gameplay Effect to either damage or heal the Character (by adding or removing a set of amount of Hit Points from the Health Attribute).\nThis demonstration setup can be found in the Content Examples project in the 02_Builtin_Clamping map.\nFor these instructions, I'm using an AttributeSet made just for this clamping demonstration, with a single Health Attribute variable.GBA_Clamping_Example_HealthSet\nAnd two Gameplay Effects, one to continuously add to the Health Attribute, one to continuously substract from the Health Attribute.GE_Clamping_HealthRegen\nGE_Clamping_HealthDegen\nBoth are Infinite Gameplay Effects, with a Period duration of 0.1, and either adds or remove 10 from the Health Attribute every 100ms.GE_Clamping_HealthRegen is configured to only be active if the Owner Character doesn't have GameplayEffect.Clamping.Degen Gameplay Tag, which is added by GE_Clamping_HealthDegen whenever it's applied.Next, we need to ensure the Regen Gameplay Effect is applied. Since it's an Infinite Effect, it'll be active indefinitely (or until explicitly removed).You can simply apply the effect programmatically on Begin Play (or Possesed) event, or using the list of Gameplay Effects to apply your GAS bakend could provide to you (GAS Companion's ASC Granted Effects, or Lyra's Ability Sets and Granted Gameplay Effects)Without any clamping applied, the Health Attribute value will go up indefinitely.And similarly go down if we apply the Degen effect (which is done in the Content Examples project by stepping onto the Button Pad Blueprint).","with-datatable#With DataTable":"This is the simplest and quickest way to get clamping done for Gameplay Attributes.This implies you're using a DataTable to initiliaze your Attribute values (eg. Data Tables section).\nIf we build upon our previous Attribute Set example, with a single Health Attribute, we can tweak the DataTable used for initialization and set the Min and Max value columns to arbitrary values. In the following example, we'll init the value to 0, but configure the clamping to ensure the value will between 10 to 100.If we launch the game in PIE, we can see the value for the Health Attribute initialized to 10 (started at 0, then clamping took place and set it to 10)To test lower and higher bound limits we configured for the clamping, we can use the Regen / Degen effect described in the Test Setup section.","with-gameplay-clamped-attribute-data-properties#With Gameplay Clamped Attribute Data properties":"Add a new Attribute for your set, but this time using a FGBAGameplayClampedAttributeData.

In this simplistic example, it's going to be on a Jump ability (another classic!).If you then compile the Blueprint and select the newly added variable, you'll see in the Details panel a slightly different display.FGBAGameplayClampedAttributeData is a child struct of FGameplayAttributeData, it contains the usual Base Value, along with two new FGBAClampDefinition properties: a MinValue and a MaxValue.The Clamp definition for both of these provides a Clamp Type behavior:\nFloat Based (default): Uses a simple, static float for the clamping.\nAttribute Based: Performs a clamping based upon another attribute.\nNone: Clamping is disabled for this definition.\nWe need another Attribute to demonstrate the Attribute Based clamping type for our Endurance attribute called MaxEndurance. Let's quickly create the new attribute.You can then give it an arbitrary value (and / or use an initialization DataTable to set its value):We can then go back to the clamped definitions of Endurance, by selecting the variable or using the Class Defaults view, and adjust the clamping definition for MaxValue to be based on the MaxEndurance attribute.\nTake note that only the Attributes belonging to the same Attribute Set are intentionally selectable.

It addresses a fundamental limitation of the Unreal Engine, making UAttributeSet fully blueprintable. This enhancement allows for a seamless workflow entirely within the Unreal Engine Editor and Blueprints, simplifying the process of working with Attribute Sets and Gameplay Attributes.","the-problem#The Problem":"Without the Blueprint Attributes plugin, Unreal Engine requires that Attributes and Attribute Sets must be created exclusively in native code, rendering Blueprint creation impossible. This limitation can be restrictive for Game Designers and Blueprint Developers, hindering their ability to iterate swiftly on Attribute design.","our-solution#Our Solution":"With this plugin, we seek to enhance the overall experience of creating and managing Attributes and Attribute Sets.Blueprint Attributes is designed as a powerful solution to the inherent limitations of Unreal Engine, specifically when it comes to the creation and management of Attributes and Attribute Sets. We recognize that Unreal Engine's default behavior mandates the creation of these vital components exclusively in native code, preventing Game Designers and Blueprint Developers from fully harnessing the potential of Blueprints during game development with GAS.Empowering Blueprint Development: Blueprint Attributes steps in to empower Blueprint Developers and Game Designers by providing a robust and user-friendly framework for managing Attributes. This means that you no longer need to rely solely on C++ coding to define and manipulate Attributes and Attribute Sets. With Blueprint Attributes, you can seamlessly integrate Attributes into your Blueprint-based workflows, eliminating the need for complex and time-consuming native code implementations.Fostering Rapid Iteration: One of the core objectives of Blueprint Attributes is to foster rapid iteration and experimentation during the game development process. By allowing you to work directly within the Unreal Engine Editor and Blueprints, Blueprint Attributes streamlines your workflow and minimizes the obstacles that traditionally slow down the iteration cycle. You can now make real-time changes to Attributes and Attribute Sets, test them, and iterate as needed without the impediments of native code development.Enhancing Collaboration: Blueprint Attributes not only empowers individual developers but also enhances collaboration within development teams. Game Designers can work closely with Blueprint Developers to fine-tune Attributes, leveraging the intuitive visual scripting capabilities of Blueprints. This fosters better communication and a more iterative and collaborative approach to game design.Preserving Compatibility: While Blueprint Attributes introduces a Blueprint-centric approach to Attribute management, it also maintains compatibility with the existing Gameplay Abilities ecosystem and workflow. This ensures that your project remains aligned with Unreal Engine's best practices while benefiting from the advantages of Blueprint-based Attribute creation.The plugin serves as a bridge between the intuitive visual scripting capabilities of Blueprints and the robust performance of native code. This allows for a seamless transition from prototyping in Blueprints to the optimized efficiency of C++. The Attribute Wizard, a key feature of Blueprint Attributes, streamlines this transition process, providing a clear path to convert Blueprint-defined Attributes into efficient C++ classes.In summary, Blueprint Attributes is your solution to breaking free from the constraints of native code when working with Attributes and Attribute Sets in Unreal Engine. By offering a user-friendly and versatile approach to Attribute management, it empowers developers, accelerates iteration cycles, encourages collaboration, and seamlessly integrates with existing workflows. With Blueprint Attributes, you're not just overcoming a limitation; you're unlocking the full potential of Unreal Engine's Blueprint system for your game development journey.","plugin-features#Plugin Features":"Blueprint Attributes comes equipped with an extensive set of features to enrich the developer experience and maintain compatibility with the existing Gameplay Abilities ecosystem and workflow. These features include:\nRuntime Module: A runtime module provides a base UAttributeSet class for inheritance.\nCustom UBlueprint and FBlueprintEditor: Custom classes that facilitate Blueprint-based Attribute management.\nEditor Modules: Additional modules for streamlined editor integration.\nDetails Customizations: A wide array of classes and Slate widgets to fine-tune attribute details within the Unreal Editor.\nAttribute Wizard: A powerful tool designed to assist in transitioning from Attributes defined in Blueprints to C++ classes. It generates the appropriate C++ class based on the AttributeSet defined in Blueprints and the Attributes it contains. This allows developers to either inherit from the generated class or migrate entirely to native implementations.\nBy providing these features, Blueprint Attributes aims to simplify the workflow and maximize flexibility when working with Attributes in Unreal Engine.","key-features-of-blueprint-attributes-plugin#Key Features of Blueprint Attributes Plugin":"Key Features of Blueprint Attributes Plugin\nQuicker Iterations\nEmpower Game Designers and Blueprint Developers to rapidly iterate on Attribute design.\nDefine Attributes in Blueprint\nCreate Attribute property variables in the Blueprint Editor for immediate use in Gameplay Effects, K2 Nodes (e.g., GetFloatAttribute()), and other locations where a Gameplay Attribute picker is applicable.\nBuilt-in Clamping\nSupport for clamping via Data Table initialization.\nHandling of \"Min Value\" and \"Max Value\" columns.\nCustomizable clamping using a special Gameplay Clamped Attribute Data property (a child of FGameplayAttributeData) with float or Attribute-based clamping.\nCustomized Blueprint Editor\nBlueprint Editor with Data Validation.\nToolbar with quick-access buttons for:\nAdding Gameplay Attribute properties.\nCreation of Data Tables.\nPorting BP Attribute Sets to standard C++ Attribute Sets.\nDetails Customizations to expose Attribute BaseValue to Blueprint and set it directly from the Details panel.\nInteractions with Gameplay Effects\nAttribute Sets can override several functions to control how an Attribute responds when a Gameplay Effect attempts to modify it.\nMost of this API is exposed to Blueprints (e.g., PostGameplayEffectExecute, Pre/PostAttributeChange).\nReplication\nReplication support for Gameplay Attributes defined in Blueprints, suitable for multiplayer projects.\nHandling of LifetimeReplicatedProps.\nIntegration of rep notifies to manage predictively modified attributes by clients (equivalent to the C++ GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_REPNOTIFY macro).\nIntegration with K2 Nodes\nK2 Nodes (Blueprint nodes) that use FGameplayAttribute parameters now display a list of Attributes defined in Blueprints in the combo box, similar to Gameplay Attribute properties in Gameplay Effects.\nAttribute Wizard for Blueprint to C++ Transition\nA wizard and Scaffold module facilitate the transition from Blueprint-defined Attributes to C++.\nGenerates proper C++ header and source files (with preview!) based on defined Gameplay Attributes in the BP Attribute Set.\nReferencer Handlers\nDetects Attribute renaming in the Blueprint Editor.\nOffers to replace previous references to the renamed Attribute in Gameplay Effects.\nDisplays a list of modified properties and Blueprint nodes (K2Nodes) in the message log with clickable links for easy navigation to the referencers.\nThese features collectively enhance your workflow, simplify Attribute management, and provide powerful tools for Blueprint-based development within Unreal Engine."}}}
